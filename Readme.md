# [This is my Personal Portfolio](https://naimchayaporfolio.netlify.app/)

Here I want to show you all the projects that I have done since December 2021.

The Portfolio is a Landing Page that has 4 sections:

- #### HOME:

  In this section you will find a brief overview of who I am and what I do.

- #### ABOUT

Here, I answer a few questions like "What do I want to work on?", "What is the reason?", "What Languages and Framewroks do I know and why did I learn them?"

- #### PORTFOLIO

If you visit this section, you will find the projects themselves.

- #### CONTACT

Finally, if you like what you saw, you can contact me.
